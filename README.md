## Description

 NoDPI is a utility designed to bypass DPI (Deep Packet Inspection). What is DPI? DPI is a technology for inspecting network packets based on their content to regulate and filter traffic. It is often used by internet service providers to censor and block access to certain web resources and protocols. The goal of this program is to "trick" DPI by modifying network packets, although in reality, this trickery is often simply a consequence of a lack of computing resources and time. 
 
 This utility was developed primarily for Russian users as a simpler (but less powerful) replacement for similar tools. In most cases, it gets the job done; in particular, it allows you to use YouTube without any problems.

 But unfortunately, the absolute performance of this utility cannot be guaranteed. Some sites, such as YouTube, are good to unlock, while others, as Instagram.com or Facebook.com, require completely different methods for bypassing locks, which are not yet implemented in this utility from their low-leveling and difficulty. Sometimes, the performance of certain sites can also depend on the provider - how it blocks the site and what technical means applies.

### How does this work

NoDPI launches a proxy server on your computer through which you direct http(s) traffic. The program intercepts ClientHello of outing connections and fragments them according to one of the following methods:

*Random fragmentation (by default)*

Clienthello is divided into several parts of random length. Each part is glued with the prefixes of the type of Clienthello and then all this is sent in one package.

*Fragmentation by SNI*

In the package there is a field containing SNI record. ClientHello is divided into 4 parts: to SNI, the first and second half of SNI, and all that is after it. The title indicating the type Clienthello is attached to each part and then all this is sent in one bag.

Also regardless of the method, the TLS version is replaced by version 1.3, which is the most modern (but this does not mean that your data begins to be transmitted according to the specifications of this version). All this together allows you to get around the lock. Apparently DPI does not yet have the necessary capacities to unravel this "ball" and simply ignore such traffic, saving time and effort. But it is possible that soon these methods will not be workers.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> NoDPI only works with HTTPS traffic. He can also take HTTP traffic, but purely for compatibility - sites working through this outdated protocol are practically not subject to unlock and the program simply sends traffic to the addressee.

NoDPI does not collect and does not send any data about you, does not use any third -party programs and libraries, does not interfere in the system processes and does not require administrator rights to work.

The entire NoDPI code is written exclusively on the Python and uses only its standard library.

### Key advantages and features

- Open source
- Easy to use, launch, and configure. The program has an intuitive interface. Using the utility requires no special knowledge; it can be launched by any user without administrator rights.
- The program works with a list of blocked domains and can automatically detect blocked websites.
- Cross-platform support ensures stable operation on Windows/Linux/MacOS. An Android version is also [available](https://github.com/gvcoder09/nodpi4android).
- The program can be integrated into a corporate network and used by staff, rather than just an individual.
- Supports error and access logging. You can see who visited specific websites and when.
- Ability to add yourself to autostart on Windows/Linux

### Sites currently unavailable via NoDPI

As of October 2025, Instagram and Facebook were not unlockable with NoDPI. Please use [GoodbyeDPI](https://github.com/ValdikSS/GoodbyeDPI) by @ValdikSS. All sites blocked by IP address are also unavailable.

## Quick start

1) Download the latest version for your OS from [the Releases page](https://github.com/GVCoder09/NoDPI/releases) and unzip it
2) Go to the directory with the unzipped utility and run it with the command `nodpi.exe --blacklist blacklist.txt` in Windows or `./nodpi --blacklist ./blacklist.txt` in Linux. You can replace the file `blacklist.txt` with your own file. **If the blacklist file is not specified, the program will search for the file `blacklist.txt` in the current directory by default.**
3) In the browser or system settings, set the proxy to 127.0.0.1:8881
4) Enjoy!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Don't forget to disable the proxy in your system or browser settings after closing the program!

Please report any problems and malfunctions to us on [the Issues page](https://github.com/GVCoder09/NoDPI/issues)

## FAQ

*Q: Is using NoDPI legal in Russia?*

A: Yes, its usage is completely legal as of October 2025. However, you can be held administratively liable for advertising and distributing tools designed to circumvent blocking.

*Q: Is it safe?*

A: Yes, using this utility is safe. All traffic sent over HTTPS remains encrypted as it was before. Furthermore, we do not collect any user information.

*Q: Does this program mask my traffic? Can my ISP not see which sites I visit?*

A: No. Unlike a VPN or Tor, this program does not hide your traffic from your Internet Service Provider (ISP). Your ISP can still see the IP addresses of the websites you connect to.
